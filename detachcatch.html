      <h5> what is it? </h5>
      <p> Detach&Catch was created for the collection of ringpulls (the tab you pull when opening a can). People have to take the ringpull of the can, drop it into the catching tray and drop the can down the chute for easy ringpull and can collection. The
        idea for it came from a teacher at school and he gave me a basic look that he wanted for it, and I improved to make it for suitable for its purpose.
        <br> I made 6 of these can chutes to be placed around school for students to use.
        <br>
        <br>Our school collects ringpulls to send to Purple Community Fund (PCF) in the Phillipines. PCF supports families and individuals who live in dumpsites and teaches them life skills so that they can sustain themselves. Among many projects, their ringpull
        product collection is one of their biggest, so our school supports them (apart from fundraisers) by sending over ringpulls for them to upcycle into bags, bracelets, accessories and many more.

        <h5> problems i encountered (so fun) </h5>
        <p> Well at first this project was all 'Boo-yah, this is going great.' And it was like that until the second print.
          <br>
          <br> Damn.
          <br>
          <br> Then I was on a roll. Of running into problems.
          <br>
          <br> Fun.
          <br>
          <br> Here are the main problems I had and how I solved them:
          <ul class="defaultlist">
            <li>Biggest problem? My printer kept getting clogged. To be fair, it was mainly because I'm still figuring out how it works and what can mess up my print. One print was so bad that it was essentially crumbling in my hands. So with the help of
              Reddit, Youtube and my brother, I unclogged my machine a couple times.</li>
            <li>The outer edge was too thin for the printer to fill in, so the plastic wouldn't stick to the layer below, causing a gap across the print at that level and the pieces were coming off. To fix those prints I decided to superglue them, and to
              prevent this problem I removed infill and increased wall count. </li>
            <li>Tolerances. After the second print, I realised they were a bit off. After adjusting this, I still had problems with a couple of later prints as I had made many edits to the settings resulting in unexpected effects on the tolerances. To not
              waste those prints, I shaved bits of the joints until they fit and superglued them. </li>
          </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

      <p> For this project in particular, I didn't have as much creative control as I did in the 'Unfolding', as it was really more of a 'I design what the person wants' sort of thing. The first image that you see in the sketches section, is what Mr Thorpe
        gave me (the teacher in charge of the project), and from there I wanted to clarify what he meant (the second image). He explained how he wanted it to be in a video he sent me, and I then went on to create a very basic 3D sketch of the chute (the
        third image). Obviously that was not going to be the final product, so I refined it and put in like a million fillets.
        <br>
        <br> However, our biggest concern with the design was how much it was going to cost. As we needed to make 6 of them, straight up printing them was costly, as it quite heavy in itself being such a big product. And that was when I found out about this
        magical little feature called: INFILL! Oh the marvel! When my brother first told me about it, I was like whoa, that's so cool, I had no idea that a printer could do that! So I messed around with the settings on Cura, so that I could reduce the
        weight of the chute until it came out to a reasonable price. But it was still turning out to be really heavy and expensive. So I had to come up with some other ideas. The list below is a combination of my ideas and ones inspired from my mum, brother
        and Mrs Sellers - the design teacher at my school.

        <br>
        <ul class="defaultlist">
          <li>The simplest + cheapest idea: Laser cutting an approprately sized bucket and PVC pipe. The PVC pipe would fit into a hole cut out in the bucket.</li>
          <li>Using wood. This idea really just came because I love working with wood, shhhhhhhhhhh. So this would be wood as the bottom base and a 3D printed tube attached above. </li>
        </ul>

        However eventually, we were able to get funding from the service department! Ms Gillman (the service teacher) said that she'd be willing to spend up to $400 on this project. This allowed me to completely 3D print the chutes. YAY!
        <br>
        <br> There was still much to do though. I added joints to the quarter prints (the can chute is quite big, and thus needed to be printed in 4 parts), adding even more fillets, and decided to add holes in the base. This was because, I figured that people
        may accidentally tip liquid in the tray part of the design as they dropped the cans down. In the end, I was really really proud of the end result.
        <br>
        <br> All I had left to do now was print, attach and superglue.
